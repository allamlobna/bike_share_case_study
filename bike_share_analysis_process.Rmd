## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing
believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number
of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how
casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From
these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to
convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic
executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up
with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Data Analysis Process

### 1) ASK

##### **Guiding Questions**

-   How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
    differently?
-   Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
-   How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to
    become members?

##### **Consider key stakeholders**

-   **Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno
    is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to
    promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social
    media, and other channels.
-   **Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented
    executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended
    marketing program.

##### **Identify the Business Task**

Both the Director of Marketing and finance analysts have concluded that
annual members are more profitable in previous analysis. Therefore, the
business task is to **present marketing strategies aimed at converting
casual riders into annual members.**

### 2) PREPARE

##### **Download data and store it appropriately.**

-   Bike Share data was retrieved from the [Kaggle Cyclistic Bike Share
    dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/cyclistic-bike-share).
    12 CSV files were downloaded and saved locally prior to importing
    the files into RStudio.
-   Chicago weather dataset is from the [National Centers for
    Environmental
    Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/locations/CITY:US170006/detail).
    The dataset was filtered to April 2021 - March 2022 and downloaded
    as a CSV file.

##### **Identify how it's organized.**

-   Bike Share: 12 months (April 2021 - March 2022) of Cyclistic Bike
    Share data is organized into 12 separate CSV (comma separated
    values) files. There are 15 columns per CSV with varying data types.
-   Weather: A CSV file of the weather in Chicago from April 2021 -
    March 2022.

##### **Verify the data's credibility.**

###### **Bike Share Data**

-   The data is slightly outdated as the last dataset was collected 8
    months ago.
-   Due to COVID-19 lockdowns and provisions, the data may not be an
    accurate representation of how different members use the bike share
    service.
-   The provided data has been made available by *Motivate International
    Inc.* under this
    [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
-   This is a public dataset that respects data-privacy by removing
    riders' personally identifiable information.

###### **Weather Data**

-   Dataset includes data from 405 different stations within the city of
    Chicago and the period of this record is 100% coverage.
-   The dataset is provided by a government entity for public use.
-   The National Climatic Data Center offers the data for free and
    ensures that the content is available and accessible to all.

### 3) PROCESS

*Code chunks show sections of the script that was used to complete the
project.
##### **Choose your tools.** 
- **Excel** - Preview the data initially, cross-referenced with any errors that arose during the cleaning process, and added the *ride_length* column. 
- **R** - Clean,process, and developed initial data visualizations. 
- **Tableau** - Visualize the data and create a dashboard.

##### **Transform the data so you can work with it effectively.**

###### **Spreadsheets - Excel**

a)  Added a column to each CSV file, *ride_length*, and formatted as
    HH:MM:SS. =(ended_at - started_at)
b)  Created a column in all CSVs called *day_of_week*, and calculated
    the day of the week that each ride started using the "WEEKDAY"
    function.

###### **R - RStudio and Github for revision control**

c)  Installed all necessary packages.

```{r error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("lubridate", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("ggplot2", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("janitor", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)

```

d)  Imported all datasets.

```{r error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
april_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202104-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202105-divvy-tripdata.csv")
june_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202106-divvy-tripdata.csv")
july_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202107-divvy-tripdata.csv")
aug_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202108-divvy-tripdata.csv")
sep_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202109-divvy-tripdata.csv")
oct_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202111-divvy-tripdata.csv")
dec_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jan_22_trip_data <- read_csv("202201-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb_22_trip_data <- read_csv("202202-divvy-tripdata.csv")
march_22_trip_data <- read_csv("202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

e)  When importing CSV files, warning message about parsing issues
    arose. This was due to *docked_bike* rows having a ride_length of
    multiple days. These rows were referenced in Excel and the errors
    appeared in the corresponding rows in the CSV files. Because
    *docked_bike* rider_types were to be removed as part of the cleaning
    process, nothing was done during this step. problem() will be used
    after removing *docked_bike* rows to confirm that all errors have
    been removed.

```{r echo=TRUE}
problems(april_21_trip_data)
#problems(may_21_trip_data)
#problems(june_21_trip_data)
#...
#problems(march_22_trip_data)
```

f)  Wrangled data and combined into single file. Using Janitor package,
    compared columns in data frames for inconsistencies. None found.

```{r echo=TRUE}
compare_df_cols(april_21_trip_data,
                may_21_trip_data, 
                june_21_trip_data,
                july_21_trip_data, 
                aug_21_trip_data,
                sep_21_trip_data,
                oct_21_trip_data,
                nov_21_trip_data,
                dec_21_trip_data,
                jan_22_trip_data,
                feb_22_trip_data,
                march_22_trip_data,
                return = "mismatch")
```

g)  Combined all data frames into one master data frame
    *total_trip_data*.

```{r echo=TRUE}
total_trip_data <- rbind(april_21_trip_data,
                         may_21_trip_data, 
                         june_21_trip_data,
                         july_21_trip_data, 
                         aug_21_trip_data,
                         sep_21_trip_data,
                         oct_21_trip_data,
                         nov_21_trip_data,
                         dec_21_trip_data,
                         jan_22_trip_data,
                         feb_22_trip_data,
                         march_22_trip_data)
str(total_trip_data)
```

##### **Document the cleaning process.**

a)  Confirmed that there are two types of members and three types of
    bikes.

Members: *casual*, *member*

Bikes: *classic_bike, electric_bike, docked_bike*

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rider_types <- total_trip_data %>%
  group_by(rideable_type, member_casual)

summarize(rider_types)
```

b)  *docked_bike* is when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for
    quality. This is irrelevant to the study, so removed from
    *total_trip_data*. Obtained total number of docked_bike to ensure
    that total removed is correct

```{r echo=TRUE}
table(total_trip_data$rideable_type)

```

```{r echo=TRUE}
total_trip_data <- 
  total_trip_data[!grepl('docked_bike', total_trip_data$rideable_type),]

table(total_trip_data$rideable_type)
```

c)  Confirmed that there are no problems found in the data frame as
    expected in step e.

```{r echo=TRUE}
problems(total_trip_data)
```

d)  *start_station_name*, *end_station_name*, *start_station_id*, and
    *end_station_id* have over 700,000 null values. Columns were removed
    as the latitude and longitude can be used for ride paths. This also
    reduced the overall dataset size to be less than 1GB which is the
    limit on Tableau Public.

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Finding total NA values in start_station_name and end_station_name
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$start_station_name))
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$end_station_name))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Removed start_station_name and end_station_name columns
total_trip_data = subset(total_trip_data, select = 
                           -c(start_station_name,end_station_name))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Finding total NA values in start_station_id and end_station_id
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$start_station_id))
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$end_station_id))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Removed start_station_id and end_station_id columns
total_trip_data = subset(total_trip_data, select = 
                           -c(start_station_id,end_station_id))
```

e)  To confirm that there are no negative *ride_length* values, we must
    find the max and min. Originally in HMS format then converted to the
    nearest seconds.

```{r echo=TRUE}
total_trip_data$ride_length <- seconds(hms(total_trip_data$ride_length))

#period_to_seconds() are used parse the time
total_trip_data$ride_length <- period_to_seconds(total_trip_data$ride_length)
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$ride_length))

```

f)  Remove all rows with NA *ride_length* values and check that all have
    been removed.

```{r echo=TRUE}
total_trip_data <- drop_na(total_trip_data, ride_length)
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$ride_length))
```

f)  Confirm that there are no negative ride length values or obvious
    discrepancies.

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(total_trip_data$ride_length)
```

##### **Aggregate your data so it's useful and accessible.**

a)  Aggregated the following data and formatted it into a data frame:

-   Average *ride_length* by rider type.
-   Median *ride_length* by rider type.
-   Maximum *ride_length* by rider type.
-   Minimum *ride_length* by rider type.
-   Average *ride_length* per day of the week by rider type.

```{r echo=TRUE}
agg_total_trip <- data.frame(
  "mean" =
    c(aggregate(total_trip_data$ride_length ~ 
                  total_trip_data$member_casual, FUN = mean)),
  "median" = 
    c(aggregate(total_trip_data$ride_length ~ 
                  total_trip_data$member_casual, FUN = median)),
  "max" =
    c(aggregate(total_trip_data$ride_length ~ 
                  total_trip_data$member_casual, FUN = max)),
  "min" = 
    c(aggregate(total_trip_data$ride_length ~ 
                  total_trip_data$member_casual, FUN = min)),
  "avg ride time per day" =
    c(aggregate(total_trip_data$ride_length ~ 
                  total_trip_data$member_casual 
                + total_trip_data$day_of_week, FUN = mean))
)
```

b)  Transposed aggregated data for easier readability

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Transposed aggregated data for easier readability
agg_total_trip <- data.frame (t(agg_total_trip))

```

c)  Prior to exporting the cleaned and transformed dataset, a quick
    visualization was created in R.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#number of rides by rider type
total_trip_data %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(day_of_week, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Rides by Rider Type", x = "Weekday", 
       y = "Number of Rides", fill = "Rider Type")
```

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#average duration
total_trip_data %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(day_of_week, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Average Ride Length by Rider Type", x = "Weekday", 
       y = "Ride Length", fill = "Rider Type")
```

### 4 & 5) ANALYZE and SHARE

a)  Dataset was exported to a CSV for use in Tableau.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
write.csv(total_trip_data,"C:\\Users\\...total_trip_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

##### **Identify trends and relationships.**

###### **Ridership:**

Members had more trips than casual riders.

###### **Daily Ridership:**

Members had more rides during the week than casual riders, but casual
riders had more rides during the weekend. This indicates that members
use the service to commute to and from work while casual riders use this
for leisure purposes.

###### **Average Ride Length:**

On average, casual riders' trips were approximately 10 minutes longer
than member trips.

###### **Average Ride Length Per Weekday:**

Casual riders always had longer trips per day than members. This did not
change on the weekends.

###### **Monthly Ridership:**

Generally, members had more rides per month than casual riders. The
increase in total trips during the summer months can be attributed to
warmer temperatures.

###### **Bike Type:**

Classic bikes were used more often by both members and casual riders.

###### **Ridership Vs. Temperature:**

There appears to be a positive correlation between the number of rides
and the average temperature for that day. A power regression shows that
casual riders tend to ride more when the temperature is warmer.

###### **Trip Start Time:**

The two graphs compare the number of trips by rider type during the week
on the weekend. The graph shows that both rider types start their trips
at similar times on the weekend, but that members start their trips
mostly at 8AM and 5PM on the weekdays. This indicates that members use
the bike share service to commute to and from work.

### 6) ACT

##### **Conclusion**

###### The following conclusions can be deduced from the analysis:

-   Members use the bike share service 17% more than casual riders.
-   Members use the bike share service to commute to and from work.
-   Casual riders ride their bikes for approximately 10 minutes longer
    than members on average.
-   There are more trips during the summer months, peaking in July.
-   As the temperature gets warmer, the number of trips increase. More
    so for the casual riders than the members.

##### **Next Steps**

###### My recommendations to the stakeholders:

-   Offer reduced membership pricing in the winter months as there are
    less riders during that time.
-   Offer a membership plan for 6 months instead of an annual
    membership. If most riders only use the service when it is warmer
    out, this may be an appealing subscription.
-   Offer a membership service that is based on ride length or total
    minutes traveled. This may entice casual riders as they tend to have
    longer ride lengths on average.
-   Launch social media ads for subscriptions in May as this is when
    people begin utilizing the bike share service.

##### **Additional Data**

###### Requests for additional data:

-   The total number of electric and classic bike types available. This
    would show what type was preferred by the riders. The current data
    does not show how many are available.
-   Membership ID's would show how often the same rider uses the
    service.
-   Membership ID's would show us how often the same rider travels the
    same path.

## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing
believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number
of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how
casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From
these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to
convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic
executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up
with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.


## Data Analysis Process

### 1) ASK

##### **Guiding Questions**
-   How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
    differently?
-   Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
-   How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to
    become members?

##### **Consider key stakeholders**

-   **Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno
    is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to
    promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social
    media, and other channels.
-   **Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented
    executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended
    marketing program.

##### **Identify the Business Task** 
Both the Director of Marketing and finance analysts have concluded that 
annual members are more profitable in previous analysis. 
Therefore, the business task is to **present marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.**  

### 2) PREPARE

##### **Download data and store it appropriately.**
Data was retrieved from the [Kaggle Cyclistic Bike Share dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/cyclistic-bike-share). 
12 CSV files were downloaded and saved locally prior to importing the files 
into RStudio.

##### **Identify how it’s organized.** 
12 months (April 2021 - March 2022) of Cyclistic Bike Share data is organized
into 12 separate CSV (comma separated values) files. There are 15 columns per 
CSV with varying data types.

##### **Verify the data's credibility.**
- The data is slightly outdated as the last dataset was collected 8 months ago.
- Due to COVID-19 lockdowns and provisions, the data may not be an accurate 
representation of how different members use the bike share service.
- The provided data has been made available by *Motivate International Inc.* 
under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
- This is a public dataset that respects data-privacy by removing riders'
personally identifiable information.


### 3) PROCESS 
*Code chunks show sections of the script that was used to complete the project.*
##### **Choose your tools.**
- **Excel** - Preview the data initially, cross-referenced with any errors that 
arose during the cleaning process, and added the *ride_length* column.
- **R** - Clean, process, and developed initial data visualizations.
- **Tableau** - Visualize the data and create a dashboard.

##### **Transform the data so you can work with it effectively.** 

###### **Spreadsheets - Excel**

a) Added a column to each CSV file, *ride_length*, and formatted as HH:MM:SS. 
=(ended_at - started_at)
b) Created a column in all CSVs called *day_of_week*, and calculated 
the day of the week that each ride started using the “WEEKDAY” function.

###### **R - RStudio and Github for revision control**

c) Installed all necessary packages.
```{r eval=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("lubridate", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("ggplot2", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("janitor", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)

```
d) Imported all data sets.

```{r eval=FALSE}
april_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202104-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202105-divvy-tripdata.csv")
june_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202106-divvy-tripdata.csv")
july_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202107-divvy-tripdata.csv")
aug_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202108-divvy-tripdata.csv")
sep_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202109-divvy-tripdata.csv")
oct_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202111-divvy-tripdata.csv")
dec_21_trip_data <- read_csv("202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jan_22_trip_data <- read_csv("202201-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb_22_trip_data <- read_csv("202202-divvy-tripdata.csv")
march_22_trip_data <- read_csv("202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```
e) When importing CSV files, warning message about parsing issues arose. This 
was due to *docked_bike* rows having a ride_length of multiple days. Excel did 
not format these columns as HH:MM:SS, however, because *docked_bike* 
rider_types were to be removed as part of the cleaning process, nothing 
was done during this step. problem() was used after removing *docked_bike* rows 
and the data did not have any parsing issues.

```{r eval=FALSE}
problems(april_21_trip_data)
#problems(may_21_trip_data)
#problems(june_21_trip_data)
#...
#problems(march_22_trip_data)
```

f) Wrangled data and combined into single file. Using Janitor package, compared 
columns in data frames for inconsistencies. None found.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
compare_df_cols(april_21_trip_data,
                may_21_trip_data, 
                june_21_trip_data,
                july_21_trip_data, 
                aug_21_trip_data,
                sep_21_trip_data,
                oct_21_trip_data,
                nov_21_trip_data,
                dec_21_trip_data,
                jan_22_trip_data,
                feb_22_trip_data,
                march_22_trip_data,
                return = "mismatch")
```

g) Combined all data frames into one master data frame *total_trip_data*.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
total_trip_data <- rbind(april_21_trip_data,
                         may_21_trip_data, 
                         june_21_trip_data,
                         july_21_trip_data, 
                         aug_21_trip_data,
                         sep_21_trip_data,
                         oct_21_trip_data,
                         nov_21_trip_data,
                         dec_21_trip_data,
                         jan_22_trip_data,
                         feb_22_trip_data,
                         march_22_trip_data)
str(total_trip_data)
```

##### **Document the cleaning process.**

a) Confirmed there are two types of members and three types of bikes.

Members: *casual*, *member*

Bikes: *classic_bike, electric_bike, docked_bike*

```{r, eval= FALSE}
rider_types <- total_trip_data %>%
  group_by(rideable_type, member_casual)

summarize(rider_types)
```

b) *docked_bike* is when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for quality.
This is irrelevant to the study, so removed from *total_trip_data*. Obtained 
total number of docked_bike to ensure that total removed is correct

```{r, eval= FALSE}
table(total_trip_data$rideable_type)

```

```{r, eval= FALSE}
total_trip_data <- 
  total_trip_data[!grepl('docked_bike', total_trip_data$rideable_type),]

table(total_trip_data$rideable_type)
```

c) Confirmed that there are no problems found in the data frame as expected in 
step e.
```{r, eval= FALSE}
problems(total_trip_data)
```

d) *start_station_name*, *end_station_name*, *start_station_id*, and *end_station_id* have over 700,000 null values. Columns were removed as the latitude and longitude can be used for ride paths. This also reduced the overall data set size to be less than 1GB which is the limit on Tableau Public.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
#Removed start_station_name and end_station_name columns
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$start_station_name))
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$end_station_name))
```
```{r, eval= FALSE}
total_trip_data = subset(total_trip_data, select = 
                           -c(start_station_name,end_station_name))
```
```{r, eval= FALSE}
#Removed start_station_id and end_station_id columns
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$start_station_id))
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$end_station_id))
```
```{r, eval= FALSE}
total_trip_data = subset(total_trip_data, select = 
                           -c(start_station_id,end_station_id))
```

e) To confirm that there are no negative *ride_length* values, needed to find the max and min. Originally in 
HMS format then converted to the nearest second to convert the column to an integer data type.
```{r, eval= FALSE}
total_trip_data$ride_length <- seconds(hms(total_trip_data$ride_length))
total_trip_data$ride_length <- period_to_seconds(total_trip_data$ride_length)
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$ride_length))

```

f) Remove all rows with NA *ride_length* values and check that all have been removed.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
total_trip_data <- drop_na(total_trip_data, ride_length)
sum(is.na(total_trip_data$ride_length))
```

f) Confirm that there are no negative ride length values or obvious discrepancies.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
summary(total_trip_data$ride_length)
```

##### **Aggregate your data so it’s useful and accessible.**
a) Aggregated the following data and formatted it into a data frame:
- Average *ride_length* by rider type.
- Median *ride_length* by rider type.
- Maximum *ride_length* by rider type.
- Minimum *ride_length* by rider type.
- Average *ride_length* per day of the week by rider type.
```{r, eval= FALSE}
agg_total_trip <- data.frame(
  "mean" =
    c(aggregate(total_trip_data$ride_length ~ 
                  total_trip_data$member_casual, FUN = mean)),
  "median" = 
    c(aggregate(total_trip_data$ride_length ~ 
                  total_trip_data$member_casual, FUN = median)),
  "max" =
    c(aggregate(total_trip_data$ride_length ~ 
                  total_trip_data$member_casual, FUN = max)),
  "min" = 
    c(aggregate(total_trip_data$ride_length ~ 
                  total_trip_data$member_casual, FUN = min)),
  "avg ride time per day" =
    c(aggregate(total_trip_data$ride_length ~ 
                  total_trip_data$member_casual 
                + total_trip_data$day_of_week, FUN = mean))
)
```
b) Transposed aggregated data for easier readability
```{r, eval= FALSE}
#Transposed aggregated data for easier readability
agg_total_trip <- data.frame (t(agg_total_trip))

```
c) Prior to exporting the cleaned and transformed dataset, a quick visualization was created in R.
```{r, eval= FALSE}
#number of rides by rider type
total_trip_data %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(day_of_week, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Rides by Rider Type", x = "Weekday", 
       y = "Number of Rides", fill = "Rider Type")
```


```{r, eval= FALSE}
#average duration
total_trip_data %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(day_of_week, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Average Ride Length by Rider Type", x = "Weekday", 
       y = "Ride Length", fill = "Rider Type")
```

### 4 & 5) ANALYZE and SHARE

a) Dataset was exported to a CSV for use in Tableau.
```{r, eval= FALSE}
write.csv(total_trip_data,"C:\\Users\\...total_trip_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


##### **Identify trends and relationships.**


###### **Ridership:** 
Members had more trips than casual riders.

###### **Daily Ridership:** 
Members had  more rides during the week than casual riders, but casual riders 
more rides during the weekend. This indicates that members use the service to
commute to and from work while casual riders use this for leisure purposes.

###### **Average Ride Length:** 
On average, casual riders' trips were approximately 10mins longer than member
trips.

###### **Average Ride Length per Weekday:** 
Casual riders always had longer trips per day than members. This did not change
on the weekends.

###### **Monthly Ridership:** 
Generally, members had more rides per month than casual riders. The increase in 
total trips during the summer months can be attributed to warmer temperatures.

###### **Ridership Vs. Temperature:** 


###### **Trip Start Time:**

# Bike Share Case Study

Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project


## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing
believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number
of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how
casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From
these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to
convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic
executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up
with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Deliverables

1.  A clear summary of the business task
2.  A description of all data sources used
3.  Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4.  A summary of your analysis
5.  Supporting visualizations and key findings
6.  High-level content recommendations based on your analysis



## Data Analysis Process <a name="Data_Analysis_Process"></a>

### 1) ASK

##### Guiding Questions
-   How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
    differently?
-   Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
-   How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to
    become members?

##### Consider key stakeholders

-   **Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno
    is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to
    promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social
    media, and other channels.
-   **Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented
    executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended
    marketing program.

##### Identify the Business Task 
Both the Director of Marketing and finance analysts have concluded that 
annual members are more profitable. 

I will present marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders 
into annual members. 

### 2) PREPARE

##### Download data and store it appropriately.
Data was retrieved from the [Kaggle Cyclistic Bike Share dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/cyclistic-bike-share). 
12 CSV files were downloaded and saved locally prior to importing the files 
into RStudio.

##### Identify how itâ€™s organized. 
12 months (April 2021 - March 2022) of Cyclistic Bike Share data is organized
into 12 separate CSV (comma separated values) files. There are 15 columns per 
CSV with varying data types.

##### Verify the data's credibility.


### 3) PROCESS 

##### Check the data for errors.

##### Choose your tools.
- **Excel** - Preview the data initially, referenced any errors that 
arose during the cleaning process, and added the ride_length column.
- **R** - Clean, Process, and initial data visualizations.
- **Tableau** - Visualize the data and create a dashboard.

##### Transform the data so you can work with it effectively. 

git config --global http.version HTTP/1.1

##### Document the cleaning process.

Notes: started to work on the data set and realized its less than 2
months of data, sample size of 30 people, and it was supposed to be for
women , but the mix is men and women
